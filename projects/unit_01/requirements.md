In order to get a satisfactory score, by the time you present your project, you **must** meet the following requirements:

### Deployment
Be deployed online, where the rest of the world can access it. We suggest you deploy your project to [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/).
* Deploy on your public Github page, not Github Enterprise.


### Version Control
Demonstrate using version control by:
* Sharing your work through a git repository hosted on Github.
* Making frequent, cohesive commits dating back to the **first day**
of the project week. A **minimum** of 30 commits is required!

### Documentation
* A `README.md` file containing:
  - A Project description
  - A Link to the Deployed App
  - A Link to the Trello Board
  - A Link to any Wirefames or Mockups (or inline photos / screenshots will work too!)
  - A list of technologies, libraries, and/or frameworks used in the project, such as `Bootstrap`, `jQuery`, or `Animate.css`
  - What you would like to add in version 2
* Wireframes or Mockups -- what does the app look like?
  - Simple: take a picture of a whiteboard drawing
  - Advanced: use a tool such as [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) or [Mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com/home)
* User Stories in a PUBLIC [Trello](https://trello.com/) board
  - You should have a Trello board tracking your User Stories
  - Board lists should include:
    * Backlog
    * Todo
    * In Progress
    * Under Review
    * Done
    * Icebox

### Sample Project `README.md` files:
* [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/iamsydsmith/tic-tac-toe)
* [FootUp](https://github.com/wschaeferiii/footup)

### Technical Specifications
Your app **must**:
* Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Switch turns between two players and/or use some A.I. to control the game (when applicable).
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Write high quality code:
  - Follow accepted naming conventions
  - Consistent indentation
  - Well-structured and readable code
  - Semantic naming of variables, functions, CSS classes, etc.
  - Short and clear functions that _do one thing_
  - Efficient code- if you have your MVP, refactor
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
  - Comment your code (pseudo code)

### DO NOT!!
Your app **must not**:
* Delete your repository at any time or start over.
* Rely on refreshing the page for any functionality.
* Have any user-facing bugs.
* Display non-functional buttons, nor buttons that do not successfully complete a task.
* Show actions at inappropriate times (example: sign out button when not signed in).
* Forms not clearing at appropriate times (example: sign up form not clearing after success).
* Allow the same game to be played after a player has won or tied.
* Allow players to move in the same square more than once (if applicable).
* Change players when an invalid move is made (if applicable).
* Use alerts for anything.
* Display errors or warnings in the console.
* Display debugging messages in the console.
